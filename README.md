# cs-what?

Who cares.

Use this instead.

A collection of CSS classes so you don't have to learn CSS.


## Borders

```
.border-1px-solid-black {
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.border-1px-solid-blue {
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.border-1px-solid-red {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```


## Backgrounds

```
.background-color-red {
  background-color: red;
}
```

## Font sizes

```
.font-size-1rem {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

Work in progress!

Coming soon.

Give us stars and we'll pay someone to write out all 32,000 classes. 

Then all you have to do is learn them all.

It might be faster and more fun to just learn CSS. You can get help on the CSS Discord https://discord.gg/pFc6XmH
